		<h2>What is BDRV?</h2>
		<p>
			<b>BDRV</b> is a squash filesystem archive (sfs) that is built for providing <inline-code>apt</inline-code> support in Puppy. It will be named as <strong>bdrv_<i>puppy-name</i>_<i>puppy-version</i>.sfs</strong> and will already be loaded in a Puppy which was built with the sfs.
		</p>
		<p>
			BDRV will have these two main programs in it:
			<ul>
				<li><inline-code>apt</inline-code>: Package manager for installing Ubuntu/Debian packages</li>
				<li><inline-code>synaptic</inline-code>: GUI for <inline-code>apt</inline-code></li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h2>Restrictions on PPM due to BDRV</h2>
		<p>
			You will find <inline-code>PPM</inline-code> (or <b>P</b>uppy <b>P</b>ackage <b>M</b>anager) in many Puppies as the default package manager which will install all the programs you want to. But, as this Puppy is built with <inline-code>apt</inline-code> support, you will find some restrictions on <inline-code>PPM</inline-code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Basically, <inline-code>PPM</inline-code> will not be able to install any package (program) which doesn't come from any of the Puppy repositories or is not in a <inline-code>.pet</inline-code> format. In simpler terms, <inline-code>PPM</inline-code> is restricted to install all those packages which <inline-code>apt</inline-code> can install.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are two reasons for such restrictions: (1) if any program was installed by the user using <inline-code>PPM</inline-code>, <inline-code>apt</inline-code> wouldn't know that the program was installed; and (2) <inline-code>PPM</inline-code> is now usually not updated and has become incapable of installing packages with deep dependencies, and sometimes causes unexpected behaviour when trying to install those.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note that, though, most Puppy packages will not have deep dependencies, which <inline-code>PPM</inline-code> can handle installation of. Hence it is allowed to install those packages.
		</p>

		<h2>Additional Reading</h2>
		<p>
			Here are documentations of related programs:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="/usr/share/synaptic/html/index.html">Synaptic documentation</a></li>
				<li><a href="/usr/local/petget/help.htm">PPM documentation</a></li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Additionally, you can run these commands to view <inline-code>apt</inline-code> and <inline-code>synaptic</inline-code>'s man pages (<inline-code>docx.sfs</inline-code> may needed to be loaded):
			<code>
				man apt
			</code>
			<code>
				man synaptic
			</code>
