		<p>
			Internationalization of applications and scripts in Puppy Linux has become extremely easy, with <b>MoManager</b>, a GUI application.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are writing software for Puppy and want that your application be internationalized, or if you want to create translations of Puppy in your language, please read this help page.
		</p>
		<section>
			<h2>Creating your own scripts that need internationalization</h2>
			<p>
				There are a lot of scripts in Puppy that use <inline-code>gettext</inline-code> for translating. For example, here are some in the woof-CE:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="https://github.com/puppylinux-woof-CE/woof-CE/blob/testing/woof-code/rootfs-skeleton/usr/sbin/Pudd">Pudd</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://github.com/puppylinux-woof-CE/woof-CE/blob/testing/woof-code/rootfs-skeleton/usr/sbin/alsawizard">alsawizard</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://github.com/puppylinux-woof-CE/woof-CE/blob/testing/woof-code/rootfs-skeleton/usr/sbin/bcrypt_gui">bcrypt_gui</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://github.com/puppylinux-woof-CE/woof-CE/blob/testing/woof-code/rootfs-skeleton/usr/sbin/connectwizard">connectwizard</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://github.com/puppylinux-woof-CE/woof-CE/blob/testing/woof-code/rootfs-skeleton/usr/sbin/fontmanager">fontmanager</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://github.com/puppylinux-woof-CE/woof-CE/blob/testing/woof-code/rootfs-skeleton/usr/sbin/logout_gui">logout_gui</a>
					</li>
				</ul>

				Inside each script you will find a line like this:

				<code>export TEXTDOMAIN=myapp</code>

				MoManager finds all scripts with this entry, which confirms that it uses <inline-code>gettext</inline-code>, and offers a GUI interface for translating each script. You do not have to learn the commandline tools for translating, the GUI interface makes it easy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Basically, MoManager will create a <inline-code>.pot</inline-code> file for the application; for example if the app is named <inline-code>myapp</inline-code>, then the .pot file will be <inline-code>myapp.pot</inline-code>. Note that multiple scripts can have the same <b>domain-name</b> (<inline-code>TEXTDOMAIN</inline-code>) set as <inline-code>myapp</inline-code> (for example), and hence just one .pot file, named <inline-code>myapp.pot</inline-code>, will be created. So, if your application has several scripts, you don't have to have a .pot for each, if you want then you can use a single .pot as well (i.e. set the same domain-name) -- this is more efficient if there are common text strings to be translated in the scripts, and is easier to be translated as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>NOTE:</b> Please place the <inline-code>export ...</inline-code> at column one, and do not place quotes around <inline-code>myapp</inline-code> (like <inline-code>"myapp"</inline-code> or <inline-code>'myapp'</inline-code>). The line in the script should look just like this:
				<code>export TEXTDOMAIN=myapp</code>
			</p>
			<p>
				<inline-code>.pot</inline-code> files are '<i>translation files</i>', for which you then have to insert the translations for a particular language. When that is done, it becomes a <inline-code>.po</inline-code> file, and then it is then compiled to a binary form and becomes a <inline-code>.mo</inline-code> file. The compiled .mo files are kept at <inline-code>/usr/share/locale</inline-code>. MoManager handles these conversions for you.
			</p>
			<section>
				<h3>Pre-existing .pot files</h3>
				<p>
					MoManager use command-line tool- <inline-code>xgettext</inline-code> to extract text strings from a script and create a .pot file from it. However this command-line tool may not always work properly. So, whenever MoManager finds an already created .pot for a program, at the location <inline-code>/usr/share/doc/nls/xxx/xxx.pot</inline-code>, it uses that .pot file instead.
				</p>
				<p>
					Note that MoManager only searches the directory <inline-code>/usr/share/doc/nls</inline-code> for any existing .pot file.

			<h2>Internationalizing Content using MoManager</h2>
			<p>
				MoManager is a GUI application written by Barry Kauler that makes it very easy for anyone to create non-English translations for applications in Puppy. All latest Puppies will have MoManager in them, which was firstly introduced to Puppy through '<i>Woof</i>' (later moved to <a href="https://github.com/puppylinux-woof-CE/woof-CE">woof-CE</a>) on '<i>February 14, 2012</i>'. If you want to use MoManager to create a '<i>langpack</i>' for a particular language it is recommended to use the very latest Puppy built from latest <a href="https://github.com/puppylinux-woof-CE/woof-CE">woof-CE</a>, which is not more than a month older. So, you may need to build your own Puppy for this process - the procedure can be found at <a href="https://github.com/puppylinux-woof-CE/woof-CE/wiki/Building-a-Puppy-on-GitHub">'Building a Puppy on GitHub' Github Wiki page</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				MoManager is for creating and updating translation files for scripts, XML files, menu files, any other data text files, and binary executables.
			</p>
			<p>
				Scripts are applications that are executable text files, usually written in <inline-code>Bash</inline-code> or <inline-code>Ash</inline-code>, or interpreted programming languages like <inline-code>Perl</inline-code>, <inline-code>Python</inline-code>, <inline-code>Tcl</inline-code>, etc. (a more technical term for scripts would be - '<i>source files of interpreted languages</i>'). This section of the help file deals with 'creating langpacks for applications' only, and not about creating scripts themselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				To use MoManager, the best thing to do is just go ahead and use it. You will find it in the <b>Utility</b> menu. Once started, you will see two columns of drop-down lists, one list is of files that already have a translation file for your language (on left side), the other list is for files that do not yet have a translation file. if you select a file from the formerlist, you may update the translation, and in the latter case you may create a new translation file.

				<h3>Scripts</h3>
				<p>
					In the case of updating an existing translation file, MoManager automatically synchronises with the latest script, and will identify any changed strings -- if you see the text "fuzzy" anywhere in the translation file, it is likely that the original English text has changed and you will need to update the translation.
				</p>
				<p>
					A translation file for a script means that when the application runs, it will output all text in your language. By creating translation files for all the scripts, you can help to create a Puppy that runs nicely in your language.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although it is probably possible to figure out how to edit a translation file, known as a 'po' file in it's editable form, or 'mo' file in it's compiled form, it is helpful to readup a bit on the topic. I suggest:
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/guide/project/howto">http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/guide/project/howto</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/gettext_9.html#PO-Files">http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/gettext_9.html#PO-Files</a></li>
					</ul>
					...note though, reading all of that can be confusing! It is possible to use MoManager without understanding all of those details. MoManager uses a normal text editor to edit .po files rather than a specialized po-editor (such as poedit) and this is quite easy to do, you just need a very basic understanding of the format of .po files.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>poedit</h3>
				<p>
					This is a special text editor for .po files. Although MoManager uses the default text editor (usually Geany in most puppies), if poedit is installed then MoManager can use it -- you will see a checkbox in the main window of MoManager to choose poedit.
				</p>
				<p>
					To install poedit, look in the Puppy Package Manager. Most builds of Puppy will have it available.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Langpack</h3>
				<p>
					You will also see in the MoManager window, a button to generate a "langpack" PET package. if you would like to translate Puppy for a particular language, this button is very nice. It will gather up all the translations for your language and put them into a PET package, which you can then send to me, and I can place it along with the others at ibiblio.org. See the existing "langpacks" at ibiblio.org, named "langpack_*.pet", for example "langpack_de-20120729.pet":
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="http://distro.ibibilio.org/quirky/pet_packages-noarch/">http://distro.ibibilio.org/quirky/pet_packages-noarch/</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Note that the langpack is accumulative. Say for example that you install "langpack_de-20120729.pet" (German). You can then create some more translations, or update existing ones, then click the "Create langpack PET" button, and a new updated PET will be created. Please let me know if this mechanism leaves anything out!
				</p>
				<p>
					There are already maintainers for some languages, for example Puppy Forum member L18L maintains the German translation. So, if you want to contribute to the German translations please do it through L18L. At the time of writing, these are the translators:
				<table>
				  <tbody>
					<tr>
				  <td>da</td>
				  <td>Danish</td>
				  <td>maans</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					  <td>de
					  </td>
					  <td>German</td>
				<td>L18L
					  </td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
				  <td>el</td>
				  <td>Greek</td>
				  <td>kounelii</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					  <td>es
