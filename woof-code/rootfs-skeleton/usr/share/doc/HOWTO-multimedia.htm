				Puppy has an excellent range of multimedia editing, conversion and viewing tools. The links are to "online help" pages on each program.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that you can install your favourite package through Puppy Package Manager (or other package manager, like <inline-code>apt</inline-code> or <inline-code>slapt</inline-code>, if present in your Puppy).
			</p>

			<h2>Graphics</h2>
			<p>
				Puppy has a very useful collection of applications and utilities for manipulating graphic images, both bitmap and vector. Programs like GIMP also support GIF (see, if you are interested, tutorial on <a href="https://itsfoss.com/make-gif-in-gimp/">GIF with GIMP</a>), though GIF is unusable unless animation is to be prepared.<br><br>
				The following table is a summary (Note that by clicking on a link in "Program" column, you can visit that program's help/documentation):

			<p>
				Gxine/Xine can play streamed audio and video off the Internet, so for example, you can listen to Internet radio stations. However, mainly for legal reasons the most up-to-date RealAudio and MicrosoftMedia "codec" files are not included in Puppy, which means that some radio stations may not work. However, you can download and install them -- see the "Streaming audio and video Gxine plugin" section at the bottom of this page.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Scanning</h2>
			<p>
				Puppy has the SANE scanner backend (with all the drivers), and XSane GUI frontend. This is all built-in to Puppy 4.xx, nothing else to install.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Printing</h2>
			<p>
				Printing in Puppy is based around Ghostscript and CUPS, and the main applications such as Abiword, Amaya, Xpaint and Firefox, generate files in Postscript format for printing. The gs program is able to convert Postscript files to a format suited to a particular printer.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Ghostscript package has its own set of printer drivers, however that is very limited, and Puppy uses the Gutenprint drivers, that work with Ghostscript. This adds support for over 1300 printers.
			</p>
			<p>
				To be able to print, you must first run the CUPS Printer Wizard. This enables you to choose the correct driver and configure it to work in Puppy. You will find this Wizard in the 'Setup' menu.
			</p>
			<p>
				CUPS, Ghostscript, fonts, and the full set of Gutenprint drivers are built-in to Puppy, so nothing else to install for printing. However, if you have a Hewlett Packard printer that is not in the Gutenprint driver-suite, there is an extra PET package available, named 'hpijs' or 'hplip'.
			</p>
		</section>
		<hr>
		<section>
			<h2>Streaming audio and video (Gxine) plugin</h2>
			<p>
				Gxine is setup as a plugin for Firefox/Seamonkey, so you can, for example, listen to Internet radio stations. Many will work, however in same cases you need to get later "codec" files for RealAudio and WindowsMedia, the two formats most commonly used for streaming audio. You do not need to install the RealPlayer or any other player, as codec files can be added to Gxine.
			</p>
			<p>
				The collection of "extra codecs" available from the Mplayer site are available as a PET package.<br>
				Just run the PETget package manager (see Menu -&gt; Setup -&gt; Puppy package manager, or just click on the 'install' icon on the desktop) and install the package named "mplayer_codecs_full".
